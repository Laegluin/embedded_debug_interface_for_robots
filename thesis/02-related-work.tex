None of the qualified teams for the \textit{RoboCup Humanoid League 2019} had a dedicated display
installed on their robots~\cite{robocup-humanoid-teams}. Outside of research contests like
\textit{RoboCup} and industrial applications, user interactions with robots are still rare.

Relatively common robots for domestic use are automatic vacuum cleaners and lawn mowers. These robots
usually feature only simple displays. Controls are limited to buttons (often capacitive). Complex
configuration and maintenance for most models can be performed using a separate application that has
to be installed on the user's phone. Examples include the \textit{Roomba} and \textit{Braava} product
lines by the American company iRobot~\cite{irobot-website}.
